UNIX

Requires different version of "cfx.h" as supplied by Macromedia CFMX.  Differences are restricted to
macro variable definitions and include files, therefore a single file was constructed with
compilation preprocessing (using "#ifdef __unix__").  This same technique is used throughout the
C++ CFX support code and relies on the use of the GNU C++ compiler (gcc/g++).



Solaris
-------
Development and testing done on Solaris 9 SPARC platform.  Need to test on Solaris 8 with installation
of gcc 3.x (gcc 2.x installation does not include required "libstdc++.so", etc).

required:
	Solaris /usr/ccs package (code development tools such as, "as" and "ld"; "ld" required).
	gcc 3.2.3
	libstdc++.so, runtime and library linking

C++ CFX dynamic library must be linked using "libstdc++.so", as follows:
		ld -dy -G -o CFX_TestTag.so CFX_TestTag.o -L/usr/local/lib -lstdc++
	ELSE,
		CFML Runtime Error
		Error = CFXNativeLib could not load native tag module:
			/usr/local/NewAtlanta/BlueDragon_Server_JX_3.1/customtags/CFX_TestTag.so.,
